    "Thermodynamic modeling has been the backbone of interpreting geologic data and modelling geologic systems for decades. However, more recent advancements in computational capabilities and a marked increase in researchers' accessibility to computing tools has outpaced the functionality and extensibility of currently available modeling tools. Here we present the first comprehensive modelling tool for H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and mixed (H$_2$O-CO$_2$) solubility in silicate melts that: a) allows users access to all commonly used models, inlcuding easy intercomparison between models; b) provides universal functionality for all models (e.g., functions for calculting saturation pressures, degassing paths, etc.); c) can process large datasets (1,000's of samples) automatically; d) outputs computed data into an excel spreadsheet for simple post-modelling analysis; e) integrates advanced plotting capabilities directly within the tool; and f) provides all of these within the framework of a python library, making the tool extensible by the user and allowing any of the model functions to be incorporated into any other code capable of calling python. The tool is presented within this manuscript, which is a Jupyter notebook containing worked examples accessible to python users with a range of skill levels. The [toolname] python library is open-source and available for download at [URL]."

    "H$_2$O and CO$_2$ are the most abundant volatile species in silicate melts and have profound effects on the phase equilibria, melting temperatures, and viscosity of magmas in addition to being drivers of explosive volcanism. Volatile elements are also key ingredients for Earth-based life, and so have become a focus of planetary exploration aimed at understanding how life came to exist on Earth and where we might find life elsewhere in the solar system and beyond.\n",

    "All of the calculations implemented in [toolname] can be performed using any of the models included. The code is structured by calculation rather than by model, which provides a more intuitive way for users to interact with the code and compare outputs from multiple models. A python class is definied for each calculation. These classes can be called as python methods, take the model name and any applicable data as arguments, and return the results of the calculation. Each class performs five key functions: 1) creates the requested model object; 2) takes user input and performs the mathematical calculation; 3) does any necessary processing of the output (e.g., normalizing totals); 4) checks that the model is being used within its calibrated range; and 5) returns calcualted outputs in an intuitive and manipulatable format (e.g., a python dictionary, a figure, or a pandas DataFrame).\n",

    "## 2.1 Format of the python library\n",
    "In this section, the basic organization and use cases of [tool name] are discussed. Specific details on how to perform model calculations are discussed in Section 3 and include worked examples. The [tool name] library is written so that users can interact first and foremost with the calculation they want to perform. Five standard calculations can be performed with any model in the library: 1) `calculate_dissolved_volatiles()`; 2) `calculate_equilibrium_fluid_composition()`; 3) `calculate_saturation_pressure()`; 4) `calculate_isobars_and_isopleths()` (plus functionality for plotting); and 5) `calculate_degassing_paths()` (plus functionality for plotting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 illustrates the basic organization of the code. First, the user determines which calculation they wish to perform by accessing one of the five core calculation classes (listed above). In this step, the user specifies any input parameters needed for the calculation (e.g., sample composition, pressure, temperature) as well as the model they wish to use. The default model is MagmaSat, but the user may specify any model in the library. As an example, the code to calculate the saturation pressure of some sample using the MagmaSat model would be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`calculate_saturation_pressure(sample=mysample, temperature=850.0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `mysample` is a dictionary or pandas Series containing the composition of the sample in oxide wt%, and the temperature is given in $^{\\circ}$C. If a different model is desired, for example Shishkina et al. (2014), it can be passed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`calculate_saturation_pressure(sample=mysample, temperature=850.0, model='Shishkina')`\n",
    "\n",
    "The core calculation classes each perform two functions: 1) a check is performed to ensure that the user input is within the model's recommended calibration range; 2) the `calculate()` method sends the user input to the appropriate model. Each model in the library is defined as a python class and contains model-specific methods for performing the five standard calculations. Standard pre-processing of the data (e.g., normalizing the composition to 100%, ignoring extranneous compositional information) is performed before the calculation and is uniquely defined for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 1 \n",
    "<img src=\"figures/code_flowchart.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*Flowchart illustrating the basic organization of the python library. First, a user chooses a calculation to perform and calls one of the five core calculation classes. Here, any necessary parameters are passed such as sample composition, pressure, and temperature. A check is run to ensure the calculation is being performed within model-specified limits. The Calculate() class then calls on one of the Model() classes. The default model is MagmaSat, but a user may specify a different model when defining the calculation parameters. Standard pre-processing is then performed on the input data, and this pre-processing step is unique to each model. The processed data are then fed into a model-specific method to perform the desired core calculation.*\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "The [tool name] code has been designed to facilitate easy use by a user with any skill level in coding or in the python language. To facilitate this, we have structured the code as two basic end-member computational paths: a batch processing path (simpler) and a single sample path (more advanced options). The level of simplicity of either path is indirectly proportional to the level of customization and extensibility (Figure 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"simplest\" way to interact with the [tool name] code is via the batch processing path. Here, the user provides input data in the form of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx file) and instructs the model to perform whatever calculation is desired. The model returns data formatted like a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which contains the user's original input data plus whatever model outputs were calculated. This path always operates in a \"verbse\" output style; that is, calculations return not only the specific calculated values requested but also any other relevant data calculated along the way. For example, a call to `calculate_saturation_pressure()` in the batch processing path returns, for every sample, the saturation pressure in bars, the mass of fluid present in grams, and the composition of the fluid present. After the calculation is performed, the user can continue to work with the returned data in their jupyter notebook or terminal window, or they can simply export the data to an excel file with one simple command `save_excel_file()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more advanced calculation path is actually the most fundamental as it allows the user access to the most basic model functions and even to hybridize models. Calculations are performed on a single sample; iterating over large datasets is left to the user to implement. However, this allows the user to input information in a variety of ways without being constrained to formatting the input data in a particular way or naming scheme. This also gives the user more flexibility in integrating any [tool name] model function into some other python code.\n",

    "## 3.2. Calculating dissolved volatile concentrations\n",
    "The `calculate_dissolved_volatiles()` function calcutions the concentration of dissolved H$_2$O and CO$_2$ in the liquid at a given pressure-temperature condition and with a given H$_2$O-CO$_2$ fluid composition, defined as the mole fraction of H$_2$O in an H$_2$O-CO$_2$ fluid (XH$_2$O$^{fluid}$). The default MagmaSat model relies on the underlying functionatlity of MELTS, whose basic function is to calculate the equilibrium phase assemblage given the bulk composition of the system and pressure-temperature conditions. To calculate dissolved volatile concentrations thus requires computing the equilibrium state of a system at fixed pressure and temperature over a range of bulk volatile concentrations until a solution is found that satisfies the user defined fluid composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the function makes an initial guess at the appropriate bulk volatile concentrations by finding the minimum dissolved volatile concentrations in the liquid at saturation, while asserting that the weight fraction of H$_2$O/$\\Sigma$volatiles in the system is equal to the user input mole fraction of H$_2$O/$\\Sigma$volatiles in the fluid. This is done by increasing the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ concentrations appropriately until a fluid phase is stable. Once fluid saturation is determined, the code then performs directional, iterative, and progressively more refined searches, increasing the proportion of H$_2$O or CO$_2$ in the system if the mole fraction of H$_2$O calculated in the fluid is greater than or less than that defined by the user, respectively. Four iterative searches are performed; the precision of the match between the calculated and defined XH$_2$O$^{fluid}$ increases from 0.1 in the first iteration to 0.01, 0.001, and finally to 0.0001. Thus, the calculated dissolved volatile concentrations correspond to a system with XH$_2$O$^{fluid}$ within 0.0001 of the user defined value.\n",

    "The `calculate_equilibrium_fluid_comp()` function calculates the composition of a fluid phase in equilibrium with a given silicate melt with known pressure, temperature, and dissolved H$_2$O and CO$_2$ concentrations. The calculation is performed simply by calculating the equilibrium state of the given sample at the given conditions and determining if that melt is fluid saturated. If the melt is saturated, fluid composition and mass are reported back. If the calculation finds that the melt is not saturated at the given pressure and temperature, values of 0.0 will be returned for the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ concentrations in the fluid.\n",
