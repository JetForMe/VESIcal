    "\n",
    "Thermodynamic modeling has been the backbone of interpreting geologic data and modelling geologic systems for decades. However, more recent advancements in computational capabilities and a marked increase in researchers' accessibility to computing tools has outpaced the functionality and extensibility of currently available modeling tools. Here we present the first comprehensive modelling tool for H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and mixed (H$_2$O-CO$_2$) solubility in silicate melts. VESIcal is a thermodynamic framework that: a) allows users access to all commonly used models, inlcuding easy intercomparison between models; b) provides universal functionality for all models (e.g., functions for calculating saturation pressures, degassing paths, etc.); c) can process large datasets (1,000's of samples) automatically; d) outputs computed data into an excel spreadsheet for simple post-modelling analysis; e) integrates advanced plotting capabilities directly within the tool; and f) provides all of these within the framework of a python library, making the tool extensible by the user and allowing any of the model functions to be incorporated into any other code capable of calling python. The tool is presented within this manuscript, which is a Jupyter notebook containing worked examples accessible to python users with a range of skill levels. The VESIcal python library is open-source and available for download at [https://github.com/kaylai/VESIcal](https://github.com/kaylai/VESIcal)."

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "<a id='introduction'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most abundant volatile components found in terrestrial magmatic systems are H$_2$O and CO$_2$. It has been known for nearly a century (Bowen, 1924; Tuttle & Bowen, 1952) that these components have profound effects on the chemical and material properties of magmas (e.g. phase equilibria, melting temperatures, magma viscosity and density), and thus significantly affect their geochemical and dynamical behavior (e.g. eruption and degassing style, role of magmatism in terrestrial C/H budgets, etc). Therefore, in order to accurately understand the behavior of magmas in both plutonic and volcanic environments, it is critical to assess how H$_2$O and CO$_2$ behave in magmatic systems as a function of intensive variables such as pressure, temperature, and melt/fluid composition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One specific and critically important behavior of volatiles in magmas is their solubility. The volatile solubility of a magma varies significantly as it rises from depth to the surface, as it is particularly dependent on the pressure, melt composition, and more weakly on temperature. Volatile solubility of a magma is defined at a given pressure and temperature as the volatile content at which a magma becomes volatile saturated; i.e., the conditions where the melt can no longer hold the volatile in solution, and there is a resulting change in the number of magmatic phases present (e.g. from melt + crystals to melt + crystals + fluid). This change from volatile under-saturated to volatile-saturated is significant in terms of both the chemical and physical evolution of a rising magma, as 1.) the formation of a volatile fluid phase comes with a large change in total volume due to bubble formation and the large molar volume of H$_2$O-CO$_2$ fluids, 2.) the bubbles themselves may increase the bulk magma viscosity (refs?) and become nucleation sites for crystals (refs?), 3.) the volatile content of the silicate melt portion of the magma is no longer constant and begins to decrease with pressure, thereby increasing the viscosity of the melt (ref’s?), and thus bulk magma viscosity, and 4.) with decreasing volatile content in the melt, mineral phase boundaries may be crossed, resulting in the stabilization (crystallization) or destabilization (reaction melting) of phenocryst phases (ref’s?). \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Experimental studies determining volatile solubility in magmas\n",
    "Given the critical importance of volatile solubility to our understanding of magmatic systems discussed above, it is no surprise that there is a great deal of past work to quantify it, starting with the classic treatise of Tuttle & Bowen (1952?). This study led to the wider recognition of the importance of volatiles, and initiated a significant effort in the development of both the experimental and analytical approaches to determining volatile solubilities as a function of pressure, temperature, and melt composition. Hamilton et al (1964) was one of the first studies that compared H$_2$O solubilities for differing melt compositions (basalt and andesite), while also investigating the effect of dissolved H$_2$O and oxidation state on the magmatic phase equilibria. This study was followed by the groundbreaking experimental measurements of the Burnham group on the dissolution of H$_2$O in albite melts (Burnham et al, 197?; 197??; Holloway et al, 19??).  Many subsequent studies have continued since, aided significantly by developments in analytical techniques to determine dissolved volatile contents, such as infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR; e.g., Stolper, 1980; Stolper et al, 198??, Fine & Stolper, 1980; etc), and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS; Hervig, Hauri, etc, need more ref’s here). The fact that both the FTIR and SIMS techniques allow micro-determinations of volatile contents on sample sizes at the ~10 micron scale, their development also facilitated a new approach to determining pre-eruptive magmatic volatile contents by allowing precise measurement of volatiles in trapped glass/melt inclusions (Wallace, Roggensack, Plank, etc).  This explosion of new information from melt inclusion measurements about pre-eruptive volatile contents made understanding volatile solubility in magmas as a function of pressure and temperature even more critical for the interpretation of the data, and highlighted the need for flexible and precise solubility models that allowed estimation of solubility conditions for a broad range of pressure, temperature, and melt/fluid compositions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Model availability prior to VESIcal\n",
    "Until now, calculating saturation pressures, dissolved volatile contents, and isobars and isopleths has been a time-consuming endeavour. In many cases, the authors of solubility models provided no accompanying tool to perform these calculations, requiring users to correctly combine and interpret the relevant equations (e.g., Dixon et al., 1995; Dixon, 1997; Liu et al., 2005; Shishkina et al., 2014). This is problematic, given that typesetting can sometimes result in errors such as typos within model equations (See Table ? for corrected versions). For some models, an excel spreadsheet is provided, or available at request from the authors. For example, Newman and Lowenstern (2002) included a simplified version of the Dixon (1997) model as part of “VolatileCalc”, which is written in Visual Basic for Excel. Due to its simplicity, allowing users to calculate saturation pressures, degassing paths, isobars and isopleths with a few button clicks and pop-up boxes, this tool has proved extremely popular (with 741 citations at the time of writing). However, to calculate saturation pressures using VolatileCalc, the user must individually enter the SiO2, H2O, CO2 content and temperature of every single sample into pop-up boxes. Similarly, the excel spreadsheet for the Moore et al. (1998) model calculates dissolved H2O contents based on the concentration of 9 oxides, temperature, and the fraction of XH2O in the vapour, which must be pasted in for every sample. Finally, Allison et al. (2019) provide an excel spreadsheet that allows users to calculate fugacities, partial pressures, isobars, isopleths and saturation pressures. Again, parameters for each sample must be entered individually, with no way to calculate large numbers of samples automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, authors have provided web-hosted interfaces to calculating saturation pressures and dissolved volatile contents (e.g., Iacono-Marziano et al., 2012; http://calcul-isto.cnrs-orleans.fr/, and Ghiorso and Gualda, 2015; http://melts.ofm-research.org/CORBA_CTserver/GG-H2O-CO2.html). Ghiorso and Gualda (2015) also provide a Mac Application. Interestingly, the web-hosted version of Magmasat returns the error message “no conv” when calculating saturation pressures for many samples which do return an output using the Mac Application. The main limitation of these tools is that they require manual entry of the concentrations of 8-10 major oxides, temperature, as well as CO2 and H2O concentrations to calculate saturation pressures, or XH2O to calculate dissolved volatile contents. Unlike the Moore et al. (1998) spreadsheet, the oxide concentrations for a single sample cannot be pasted in en-mass, but must be individually typed or pasted into each box. This is particularly time consuming for melt inclusion studies, where saturation pressures are calculated for hundreds of inclusions, each with different entrapment temperatures, CO2, H2O, and major element concentrations. For example, the saturation pressures from 105 Gakkel ridge melt inclusions calculated in Magmasat by Bennet et al. (2019) required the manual entry of 1365 values! The potential for user error in this data entry stage should not be overlooked. Another issue with these web-hosted tools is their longevity; the link provided in the Iacono-Marziano et al. (2012) manuscript returns an error “this site cannot be reached”, although email contact with the author directed us towards the newer link given above. Similarly, the web tool for the popular Papale et al. (2006) H2O-CO2 solubility model no longer works (due to updates in MELTS?), and the link to H2O-CO2 equation of state web tool of Duan and Zhang (2006) provided in their manuscript returns a 404 error. \n",

    "In contrast, VESIcal is an open source tool and as such is far less prone to the preservation issues discussed above. Because the VESIcal code is hosted on GitHub, every change to the code is tracked publicly (Perkel, 2016).

VESIcal represents the first volatile solubility tool with the ability to perform calculations for multiple samples at once, with built-in functionality for extracting data from an Excel file. In addition, the code is written such that it is flexible (sample, calculation type, and model type can be chosen discretely) and extensible (VESIcal code can be easily imported for use in python scripts, and the code is formatted such that new volatile models can be easily added).\n",

Instead, VESIcal provides one set of tools that can access and utilize all of these models.\n",

    "VESIcal has been designed for practicality and ease of use. It is designed to be used by anyone, from someone who is completely unfamiliar with coding to an adept programmer. The non-coder user can interact with VESIcal through this manuscript, and can upload a file with data, execute the tutorial below, and save the results to an Excel file to work with outside of VESIcal. The programmer user may wish to use the more advanced functionality provided by VESIcal, including the ability to hybridize models (e.g., use one model for H$_2$O and another for CO$_2$) or write their own routines and code that calls VESIcal methods.

    "## 2.2 Format of the python library\n",
    "In this section, the basic organization and use cases of VESIcal are discussed. Specific details on how to perform model calculations are discussed in Section 3 and include worked examples. The VESIcal library is written so that users can interact first and foremost with the calculation they want to perform. Five standard calculations can be performed with any model in the library: \n",
    "1. `calculate_dissolved_volatiles()`\n",
    "2. `calculate_equilibrium_fluid_composition()`\n",
    "3. `calculate_saturation_pressure()`\n",
    "4. `calculate_isobars_and_isopleths()` (plus functionality for plotting; only for mixed volatiles models)\n",
    "5. `calculate_degassing_path()` (plus functionality for plotting; only for mixed volatiles models)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 illustrates the basic organization of the code. First, the user determines which calculation they wish to perform by accessing one of the five core calculation classes (listed above). In this step, the user specifies any input parameters needed for the calculation (e.g., sample composition, pressure, temperature) as well as the model they wish to use. The default model is MagmaSat, but the user may specify any model in the library. As an example, the code to calculate the saturation pressure of some sample using the MagmaSat model would be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`calculate_saturation_pressure(sample=mysample, temperature=850.0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `mysample` is a dictionary or pandas Series containing the composition of the sample in oxide wt%, and the temperature is given in $^{\\circ}$C. If a different model is desired, for example Shishkina et al. (2014), it can be passed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`calculate_saturation_pressure(sample=mysample, temperature=850.0, model='Shishkina')`\n",
    "\n",
    "The core calculation classes each perform two functions: 1) a check is performed to ensure that the user input is within the model's recommended calibration range; 2) the `calculate()` method sends the user input to the appropriate model. Each model in the library is defined as a python class and contains model-specific methods for performing the five standard calculations. Standard pre-processing of the data (e.g., normalizing the composition to 100%, ignoring extranneous compositional information) is performed before the calculation and is uniquely defined for each model.\n",

Here, any necessary parameters are passed such as sample composition, pressure, and temperature. A check is run to ensure the calculation is being performed within model-specified limits. The Calculate() class then calls on one of the Model() classes. The default model is MagmaSat, but a user may specify a different model when defining the calculation parameters. Standard pre-processing is then performed on the input data, and this pre-processing step is unique to each model. The processed data are then fed into a model-specific method to perform the desired core calculation.*\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "The VESIcal code has been designed to facilitate easy use by a user with any skill level in coding or in the python language. To facilitate this, we have structured the code as two basic end-member computational paths: a batch processing path (simpler) and a single sample path (more advanced options). The level of simplicity of either path is indirectly proportional to the level of customization and extensibility (Figure 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"simplest\" way to interact with the VESIcal code is via the batch processing path. Here, the user provides input data in the form of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx file) and instructs the model to perform whatever calculation is desired. The model returns data formatted like a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which contains the user's original input data plus whatever model outputs were calculated. This path always operates in a \"verbse\" output style; that is, calculations return not only the specific calculated values requested but also any other relevant data calculated along the way. For example, a call to `calculate_saturation_pressure()` in the batch processing path returns, for every sample, the saturation pressure in bars, the mass of fluid present in grams, and the composition of the fluid present. After the calculation is performed, the user can continue to work with the returned data in their jupyter notebook or terminal window, or they can simply export the data to an excel file with one simple command `save_excel_file()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more advanced calculation path is actually the most fundamental as it allows the user access to the most basic model functions and even to hybridize models. Calculations are performed on a single sample; iterating over large datasets is left to the user to implement. However, this allows the user to input information in a variety of ways without being constrained to formatting the input data in a particular way or naming scheme. This also gives the user more flexibility in integrating any VESIcal model function into some other python code.\n",

This allows additional models to be added to VESIcal by defining only the (simpler) expressions describing pure fluid solubility. Non-ideality of mixing in the fluid or magma phases can be incorporated by defining activity and fugacity models, which are then accessed by the pure-fluid models. We provide a summary here of how we approach calculating the properties of mixed-fluid systems."

    "Whilst the variables required for each pure-fluid solubility model are different, we take a very similar approach to calculating fluid properties for each. In general pure-fluid models provide analytical expressions for the concentration of a volatile species dissolved in a magma as a function of either its partial-pressure or fugacity in the vapour phase. To provide a homogeneous framework, each model must have a fugacity model associated with it. Where a solubility model uses partial-pressure in place of fugacity, the fugacity model is set to being an ideal gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, an analytical expression does not exist for the inverse calculation, i.e., calculating the saturation pressure given the concentration of dissolved volatile species. The calculation must then be solved numerically. Numerical methods obtain the answer by making guesses for the saturation pressure, checking whether the predicted concentration of the dissolved volatile species matches the measured value, and refining the guesses as appropriate. When the saturation pressure is found, this equality holds:\n",

The advantage of using a generic scipy algorithm, in preference to creating a bespoke routine, is that it affords us flexibility in how the problem is solved, and the algorithm is underlain by robust, well-tested, efficient code."

This in turn fixes the partial pressure of H$_2$O, allowing us to calculate $X^L_{\\textrm{H}_2 \\textrm{O}}$ consistent with that guess.

The default MagmaSat model relies on the underlying functionatlity of MELTS, whose basic function is to calculate the equilibrium phase assemblage given the bulk composition of the system and pressure-temperature conditions. To calculate dissolved volatile concentrations thus requires computing the equilibrium state of a system at fixed pressure and temperature over a range of bulk volatile concentrations until a solution is found that satisfies the user defined fluid composition.\n",

    "First, the function makes an initial guess at the appropriate bulk volatile concentrations by finding the minimum dissolved volatile concentrations in the liquid at saturation, while asserting that the weight fraction of H$_2$O/$\\Sigma$volatiles in the system is equal to the user input mole fraction of H$_2$O/$\\Sigma$volatiles in the fluid. This is done by increasing the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ concentrations appropriately until a fluid phase is stable. Once fluid saturation is determined, the code then performs directional, iterative, and progressively more refined searches, increasing the proportion of H$_2$O or CO$_2$ in the system if the mole fraction of H$_2$O calculated in the fluid is greater than or less than that defined by the user, respectively. Four iterative searches are performed; the precision of the match between the calculated and defined XH$_2$O$^{fluid}$ increases from 0.1 in the first iteration to 0.01, 0.001, and finally to 0.0001. Thus, the calculated dissolved volatile concentrations correspond to a system with XH$_2$O$^{fluid}$ within 0.0001 of the user defined value.\n",
